# Blood Cell Detection

This repository contains a project focused on the detection and classification of blood cells using machine learning techniques. The model leverages a deep learning architecture to analyze blood cell images and classify them into various categories for medical diagnosis.

## Project Overview

Blood cell detection plays a crucial role in medical diagnostics, helping healthcare professionals quickly and accurately identify abnormal cells in blood samples. This project aims to automate the detection process by training a deep learning model on a dataset of blood cell images. The trained model can classify different types of blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Blood Cell Count Dataset (BCCD)**, which contains labeled images of blood cells. The dataset includes various types of cells, such as:

- Red Blood Cells (RBC)
- White Blood Cells (WBC)
- Platelets
